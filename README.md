# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Neural Network application

## Overview
We are using our knowledge of machine learning and nueral networks to create a binary classifier that will be able to predict whether applicants will be successful if they are funded by Alphabet Soup. Alphabet Soup has provied a dataset containing over 34,000 organizations that have been funded from over the years. It is up to us to preprocess the data, which involves finding the target(s), finding the features, and droping unnecessary columns. The columns provided are:
- `EIN` and `NAME`: identification columns
- `APPLICATION_TYPE`: Alphabet Soup application type
- `AFFILIATION`: Affiliated sector of industry
- `CLASSIFICATION`: Government organization calssification
- `USE_CASE`: Use case for funding
- `STATUS`: Active Status
- `INCOME_AMT`: Income classification
- `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`: Special Consideration for application
- `ASK_AMT`: Funding amount requested
- `IS_SUCCESSFUL`: Was the money used effectively
